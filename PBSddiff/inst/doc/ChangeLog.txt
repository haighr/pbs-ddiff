1.2.0 (2017-08-11)
  • Made changes in `pcod_iscamFigs.r' (RH 170803)
	* Revised the phase (smail) plot to more easily see the start and end points.
	* Changed the aurocorrelation plot function from `autocorr.plot' (in coda pkg) to `acf' (in stats pkg).

  • Made changes in `pcod_iscamExecutiveSummary.r' (RH 170802)
	* Added code to grab  the nearest available catch policy from the user's input to `tac.use'.
	* Replaced repetitive HRP code with calls to the function `calcHRP'.
	* Updated spawning biomass function `fig.b' to honour user's TAC input and to show TACs next to catch bars.
  • Made changes in `pcod_iscam.r' (RH 170802)
	* Sourced `calcHRP.r'; de-activated loading of `Hmisc'.
	* Replaced use of `match' with `is.element' to avoid potential NA values.

1.1.1 (2017-05-12)
  • Updated `table.decision', `fig.b', `fig.c'   to use values from `calcHRP'. (RH 170512)
  • Added the current value of depletion (2017) to the MCMC depletion plot. (RH 170512)
  • Modified (added?) the calculations for quantiles in table `PBMQuants.csv' (RH 170512)
  

1.1.0 (2017-05-05)
  • Added a new function called `calcHRP' to calculate historical reference points in a consistent fashion (RH 170505)
	(rather than repeat these calculations in various other function) and return the output in a list object.
  • Changed the figure for reporting B and F control points to be side-by-side and added Fmax. (RH 170505)
  • Fixed some bugs that to allow code to run when building Sqweave appendices, i.e., not running code from GUI (RH 170505).
  • Added HRP values to the table `PBMQuants.csv' (RH 170504)
  • Changed GUI code to show updated snail trail plots. (RH 170504)

1.0.3 (2017-04-20)
  • Created function `fig.snail' to deal with snail plots in MSY space (ut/umsy vs Bt/Bmsy) or HRP space (ut/uavg vs Bt/Bavg). (RH 170420)
  • Modified `pcod_iscamSens.r' to deal with different numbers of MCMC samples -- changed from `cbind` to dynamic list object. (RH 170420)
  • Updated R code to use burn-ins from cribtab (as opposed to using the last 1000 samples). (RH 170420)
  • Updated source code `pcod_iscamSens.r' to deal with different burn-ins for the various sensitivities. (RH 170417)

1.0.2 (2017-04-12)
  • Updated code to output Historical Reference Point decsion table (RH 170412)

1.0.1 (2017-04-07)
  • Updated code to (hopefully) write all figures and tables (buggy before). (RH 170407)
  • Updated various R-code files to incorporate a unique burn-in time for each run. (RH 170404)
  • Added `runHistory' file to keep track of the runs made for Walleye Pollock (North and South). (RH 170404)
  • Fixed bugs in `pcod_iscamFigs.r' code where burn-in was being applied twice and thinning was not performed. (RH 170403)

1.0.0 (2017-03-28)
  • Collected Chris' much revised DDiff project into SVN repo. (RH 161130)
	This version was based on a Pacific Cod model from 2015 which was altered to use with SST (2015) and WAP (2017).
	CG has an entirely new version that also makes use of the age-structured component in SM's iSCAM model.

0.9.9 (2017-03-27)
  • Modified scripts in `pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamExecutiveSummary.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', and `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt'. (RH 170327)

0.9.8 (2017-03-24)
  • Modified scripts in `cribtab.r', `pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt', `pcod_iscamLoadScenarios.r', and `reptolist.r'. (RH 170324)
	Generally, let's keep the North and South models separate using:
	1. separate directories under "DDiff" -- "Scenarios_North" and "Scenarios_South";
	2. directories under Scenarios_North called Nassess01, Nassess02, ... (same under Scenarios_South using Sassess01, etc.);
	3. The data files need to be called 'wapNassess01dd.dat', 'wapNassess01dd.ctl', and 'wapNassess01dd.pfc' under Nassess01. Obviously the number changes as we add scenarios. Use the same file-naming convention for the South (e.g., 'wapSassess01dd.dat');
	4. The file 'iscamdelaydiff.dat' in each folder needs to specify the three relevant filenames for the scenario.

0.9.7 (2017-01-09)
  • Modified scripts in `cribtab.r', `pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamExecutiveSummary.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt', and `pcod_iscamSens.r'. (RH 170109)

0.9.6 (2017-01-06)
  • Modified scripts in `cribtab.r', 'pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamExecutiveSummary.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt', `pcod_iscamLoadScenarios.r', `pcod_iscamSens.r', and `pcod_iscamUtils.r' (RH 170106)
	All I could think about today was you tramping in beautiful summer sunshine atop a beautiful NZ ridge. Bastardo. I hope you thoroughly enjoyed yourself.

0.9.5 (2017-01-05)
  • Modified scripts in `pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamExecutiveSummary.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt', and `pcod_iscamSens.r'. (RH 170105)
	Some comments:
	1. The PFC file only goes up to 2000t; however, the latest MP outside TAC is something like 3110t.
	2. For the Bmin MCMCs, I was taking the minimum Bt from each MCMC sample, but it just occurred to me that these minima may not always occur in 2008. Do you want to always use the MCMC samples from 2008 or the minimum from each MCMC sample, regardless of year?
	3. The GUI has a few new widgets like a checkbox to use the historical average (in place of B0).  Tabs ES and MB both have this checkbox and they are linked so if you turn it off in one tab, it will turn off in both tabs. The historical average only affects the depletion graphs in the ES tab. The option also affects a few plots under the Reference Points in the MB tab. I'll leave you to play with these and let me know what you think.

0.9.4 (2016-12-23)
  • Modified scripts in `cribtab.r', `pcod_iscam.r', `pcod_iscamFigs.r', `pcod_iscamGuiWin.txt', `pcod_iscamLoadScenarios.r', `pcod_iscamSens.r', `ScenDesc.txt', and `ScenGroup.txt' (RH 161223)
	Attached are the latest scripts. Just extract them to your rscripts-pbs directory.
	As usual, to run the whole shebang:
		source("pcod_iscam.r"): pcod_iscam()
	Merry Christmas. Keep me posted. I'll monitor my email over the holidays.

0.9.3 (2016-12-22)
  • Modified the code and GUI a bit to allow the user to change Scenario directories, if he wishes. 
	In the first tab, you can change the Scenario directory entry and press Enter.
	The code then switches to the new directory, loads the scenarios and reloads the GUI.
	This comes in handy when we place some scenarios in different directories than other scenarios.
	Comparisons among scenarios can only be done with scenarios in a single directory. 
	So we lose some flexibility, but you can always manually copy and paste scenarios to whatever directory you want.
  • Modified scripts in `pcod_iscamFigs.r'. (161222)
	You will need the attached R code. 
	As expected, the function fig.weightFit need to be modified to take into account the matrix format of the mean weights. 
	BTW, the fit to mean weights is not good.

0.9.2 (2016-12-21)
  • Implemented the change that Robyn suggested.  Makes a lot of sense and hopefully it will work! (PJS 161221)
	The way you had it you will hit an overflow at L120. (RF 161221)
	However I don’t think your new approach works either because the counter in the for loop will increment by 1 year so you would still get a too-long vector and an overflow.
	You need to be working with vectors with length = n_weight (the number of observations).
	Challenge is the indexing for the predicted weights is syr to nyr.
	Solution is to use your loop to select the right prediction for each observation.
	ALSO, I think you were overwriting nlvec(7) at each step. 
	Could use += but I think you actually want to fit the whole time series at once so I have moved that out of the loop.
	This should work (?):
		dvar_vector pred_annual_mean_wt(1, n_weight);
		dvar_vector epsilon_wt(1, n_weight);
		epsilon_wt.initialize(); 
		int stepy
		for(i=1; i<=n_weight; i++)
		{
			stepy=obs_annual_mean_wt(i,1);
			pred_annual_mean_wt(i) = annual_mean_wt(stepy);
			epsilon_wt(i) = log(pred_annual_mean_wt(i)) - log(obs_annual_mean_wt(i,2));     
		}
		if(cntrl(15)) nlvec(7) = dnorm(epsilon_wt,weight_sig); //fit to annual mean weight if cntrl 15 is switched on
	This is the vector version of dnorm. Gets summed at L2232 

0.9.1 (2016-12-16)
  • Modified pcod_iscam.r so that now you can specify on line 51 a single directory where you keep your iscamdelaydiff.exe. (RH 161216)
	It really only matters when you use the GUI to run the model using the OUT tab.

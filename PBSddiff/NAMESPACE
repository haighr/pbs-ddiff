# PBSddiff -- NAMESPACE will need work if this becomes an R package.

# Export all functions that do NOT begin with a dot (period)
exportPattern("^[^\\.]")

# Export dot functions by action (explicit list just to keep track)
exportPattern("^\\.PBS")
exportPattern("^\\.comp")
exportPattern("^\\.flush")

# Packages declared in the 'Depends' field should not also be in the 'Imports' field (from R-exts.pdf).
# RH: In NAMESPACE, package can either be in `import' OR `importFrom', NOT both.
#     But all packages named in `import' AND `importFrom' must appear in DESCRIPTION after `Imports:'.

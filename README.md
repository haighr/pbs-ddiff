### PBS delay-difference ###

**PBSddiff** contains R code for GUI control of iSCAM delay-difference model output for multiple scenarios. The code was originally created by Chris Grandin (PBS) for a Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus* ) assessment, hence the prefix `pcod`, and subsequently adapted by Rowan Haigh (PBS) and Paul Starr (CGRCS) for use in stock assessments of Shortspine Thornyhead [1] (*Sebastolubus alascanus*) and Walleye Pollock (*Theragra chalcogramma*). The repository is set up to mimic an R package source repository; however, it currently does not meet requirements for building an R package.

The `tpl` code to convert to C++ via ADMB and then compile to a Windows binary (and perhaps an appliance on the African operating system Ubuntu) comes from Steve Martell originally and has subsequently been modified by us and others (e.g., <https://github.com/cgrandin/iSCAM>).
